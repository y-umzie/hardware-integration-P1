Using NRF52840 module, BME280 sensor, Green LED and Red LED.
Write a code and provide documentation of steps involved in establishing communication of SDK to Hardware, along with circuit diagram for the below mentioned problem.

Note: The device should communicate with software via Bluetooth protocol. 
The code should be flashed to hardware using JTAG, not via a serial protocol.
Turn power switch to ON: If battery is connected the Green LED should glows for 1 second and then stops. 
If sensor is not attached to the module, Red LED glows for 1 second and then stops and advertise the same using Bluetooth.
